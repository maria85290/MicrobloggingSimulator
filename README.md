# Microblogging Environment Simulator

 
We present a platform that simulates social media microblogging, inspired by the Twitter layout, with the aim of creating an environment where social media-focused studies can be conducted without compromising ethical values.  The end result is a platform tested in a lab environment with the ability to present the content (in the format of post) to validate or investigate and record user interactions.

###  To use the platform, you can follow the next steps:

1. Download this repository;
Execute:
2. docker-compose up -d --build\end{verbatim}
3. populate.bat (for a default database population) 
4. Access the web application page: \url{http://localhost:8000/home};
